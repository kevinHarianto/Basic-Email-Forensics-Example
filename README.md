# Basic-Email-Forensics-Example
Using an open source tool called MXLookup to look into email and their security features I have set up a step by step practice that you can follow along.
Information on most of the relevant email security features that I found are located into this documentation for easy access and analysis of emails. 
Please let me know if I should include any additional email security terminology and some openly available resources to gather more in depth information on email analysis for forensic purposes and experimentation.
